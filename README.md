# Medical Cost Data Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the Medical Cost Personal Dataset by encoding categorical variables, removing outliers, and standardizing features to prepare the dataset for further analysis.

## Project Structure
- `[Medical Cost Personal Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)/`: Contains the dataset.
- `[Deep Data Cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/code/elsiemicah/deep-data-cleaning)/`: Contains Jupyter Notebook with code and explanations.

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Initial Data Inspection**: Examined data types, missing values, and initial distributions.
2. **Encoding**: Converted categorical features to numeric values.
3. **Outlier Removal**: Used the IQR method to remove outliers from `charges` and `bmi`.
4. **Scaling**: Standardized numerical features.
5. **Visualization**: Visualized data distributions before and after cleaning.
